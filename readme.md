This is an altered version of the Hipparcos catalog inteneded to be easier to use.  The original catalog has RA/DEC coordinates
for the equinox of 1991.25.  Here I have converted the coordinates to J2000 using the NOVAS function "transform_hip".  I have
also removed many fields which are of little use to amateurs.  There are several versions available here, which contain
stars down to different magnitude levels.  For example Hipparcos_6.js contains all stars with magnitude less than 6.  Magnitude
6.5 gets special recognition since it is considered to be the limiting magnitude of human vision.  Though sky conditions
will affect the actual limit.
